## Description

As the game begins, you slowly wake up in a dimly-lit, quiet classroom. You’re Amelia, a shy preschooler, who has accidentally slept through evening class. The once familiar room now feels like a cage. The large classroom door is slammed shut, locking you inside. The oppressive silence is only broken by the distant echoes of twisted laughter. These laughters get louder and louder as you move closer to the door. Through the door, you glimpse your parents, embroiled in a heated argument with the school's janitor. Panic surges within you as you realize something is terribly wrong.
Every creak of the floorboards and flicker of the fluorescent lights sends shivers down your spine. You need to keep your wits about you to find the key that will unlock the door and lead you deeper into the school—each step you take bringing you closer to your trapped parents and revealing the horrifying truth.

Do you have what it takes to guide Amelia through her first fright and unravel the sinister mysteries in the school?
