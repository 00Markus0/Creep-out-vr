## Description

You’re the shy, timid pre-schooler Amelia, a young girl trapped in a horrifying school where a teacher has a sick obsession with you. The further you explore the school, the more you realize how twisted his plans are for you. So whatever you do, you can’t let this terrifying person catch you. Your final goal is to break out of the school, but this evil villain managed to trap your parents. Can you find your parents and be able to save them? Will you ever be able to escape this nightmarish school? Experience the first glimpse into this dreadful horror story with this demo of our game. But beware, do not fall off your seat!
